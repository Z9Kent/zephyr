Notes for serialization object

Deserialize structure:

1. Read input (increasing order only for mbufs) as character sequence

2. Assemble <N> characters into value. Value types are:
    - integral fixed length (signed/unsigned): network order
    - enumeration type, normally 1 byte
    - character string, fixed length, (ie raw bytes)
    - structure type (structure composed of previous types)
    - array of structures (max N), last element

3. Placed in Raw Memory in structure
    - element info: offsetof, sizeof, name

4. For enumerations: accept all values into to deserialize type for introspection

5. When Deserializing with DISCRIMINATOR, return `type`
