# modified to remove mbedTLS configuration variables, so that
# zephyr definitions don't interfere.

# conditioned on `CONFIG_Z9_GCM_C`
# convert to C++ and place in namesapce z9::z9_gcm_c to prevent naming conflicts
# rename `MBEDTLS_*` #defines in `config.h` to `Z9_*` to prevent conflicts
# use `std::` routines instead of `utils.c` methods

# modified to use ROM for tables instead of RAM
